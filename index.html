      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to
        consider canteens must be better organised anjs more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
        with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and
        parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be
        provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
        and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can 
        eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
        Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

      <h4>Implented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
      <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
        Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
        management systems ensure accurate time records and minimalize the inevitable and costly erros with manual data
        entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
        <br>
        2. Economics
        Have you ever thought that attendance mangement systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end 
        to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter 
        of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after
        implementing automated attendance management system.
        <br>
        3. Productivity / Efficiency
        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes
        time to procces paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, ad create
        payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from 
        keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and 
        effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of ressources which lead to increased 
        productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management,
        flexibillity, Intergration / Configuration, Real-tine tracking, Security, and Compliance.
